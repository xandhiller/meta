# Scripts

Various scripts I write for my own personal convenience -- just to save me typing the same things frequently. Placing them on GitHub so they have a place to live and can be restored in the future.

File format must:
* Be executable, i.e. `chmod +x` must be run on the file.
* Be named with the extension `.sh`, `.py` etc. It should instead utilise the appropriate shebang to begin the file, e.g. `#! /bin/sh`
